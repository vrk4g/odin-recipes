# odin-recipes

Odin Recipes is a simple website containing some dishes I'd like to try.

By developing this website I've honed such skills as working with HTML: HTML boilerplate, headings, images, lists and links; and working with Git: cloning, staging and committing.

On the second iteration of the Odin Recipes project I worked with CSS and its properties. To be more precise I worked with such CSS properties as: font-family, font-size, font-weight, color, background-color, text-align, width, height, etc.
