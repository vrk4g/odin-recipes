        <h3 class="funny-text">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, garlic, and oregano, and garlic together in a large glass bowl. Add
                pork,
                onions, and bell peppers, and stir until coated. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Remove pork and vegetables from marinade and shake off excess; thread onto skewers. Discard remaining
                marinade.</li>
            <li>Cook on the preheated grill, turning frequently, until pork is no longer pink in the middle, 10 to 15
                minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63
                degrees
                C).</li>
