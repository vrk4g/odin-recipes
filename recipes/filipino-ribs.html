    <h2>Filipino Ribs Glazed With the Sweet, Tangy Taste of the Philippines</h2>
    <p>Spareribs glazed with the sweet, tangy taste of the Philippines. One of the honey coating ingredients, star
        anise, is native to China; it is a star-shaped, dark brown pod that contains a pea-sized seed in each of its
        eight segments. Star anise is available at all Asian markets as well as many general grocery stores.</p>
