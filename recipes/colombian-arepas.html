    <h2>Colombian Arepas Made With Mozzarella Cheese</h2>
    <p>Colombian arepas made with mozzarella cheese are quick and easy to make with this recipe. They are usually served
        for breakfast, as a side dish, or even for a quick meal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 cup pre-cooked white cornmeal (such as P.A.N.)</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix water, cornmeal, mozzarella cheese, butter, and salt together in a large bowl. Knead until well combined
            and a soft dough forms. Form dough into balls the size of a medium orange. Place each ball between two
            sheets of plastic wrap and flatten with a rolling pin to the desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Leaving plastic wrap in place, press the top edge of a cereal bowl or drinking glass into the surface of the
            dough to cut circles. Remove the plastic wrap and remove any excess dough scraps.</li>
        <li>Spray a griddle with cooking spray and set over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook arepas on the hot
            griddle until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
